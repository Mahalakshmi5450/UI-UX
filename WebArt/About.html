        <h2> ABOUT</h2>


   <p>
    This website showcases analyses of highly interactive websites from around the internet, such as Joshua's World, NeuroFlowers, Prometheus Fuels, and Every Last Drop! It provides insights into their purpose, the causes they support, their origins, launch dates, creators, and the technologies used to build them.

    Similarly, I, Mahalakshmi, have created this website to compile and share the interactive websites that inspire me. I am a third-year BMS (Hons) student at Vidyashilp University, Bangalore. This website was developed using HTML and CSS on Visual Studio Code.
